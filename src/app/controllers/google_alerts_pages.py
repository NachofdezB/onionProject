# @ Description: Automates extracting real URLs from Google Alerts RSS feeds.
# It reads feed URLs from a file, parses each feed to retrieve entries, cleans
# redirected links to get the actual URLs, and saves them to an output file.
# Logging with loguru is included for monitoring the process.

    @brief Extracts the real URL from a Google Alerts redirect link.

    Google Alerts often provides links that redirect through Google's own
    tracking system. This function parses the URL and extracts the actual
    destination URL from the query string.

    @param url: The full Google redirect URL
    (typically containing a ?url= parameter).
    @return: The real target URL extracted from the redirect,
    or the original URL if not found.

    @brief Parses Google Alerts RSS feeds and extracts the real destination
    URLs.

    This function reads RSS feed URLs from a file, parses each feed using
    `feedparser`, and extracts the actual destination URLs from redirect links
    (typical in Google Alerts). It removes any redirect/tracking wrappers,
    cleans the URLs, and writes the final list to a specified output file.

    The input file (defined by FEEDS_FILE_PATH) should contain one feed URL
    per line. Lines may optionally contain additional info after
    a '|' character, which will be ignored.

    @note Uses the `clean_google_redirect_url()` helper to extract real URLs
    from redirect links.
    @note Logs progress and warnings using the `loguru` logger.

    @return None. The function writes output to a file and logs progress.

# @ Description:
# This module defines Pydantic data models used throughout the application
# for validating, processing, and representing RSS feed data.
# It includes models for creating and retrieving feed metadata from the database,
# handling lists of feed URLs, and processing Google Alert RSS feed entries and feeds.
# These models ensure data integrity and provide clear structure for API requests and responses.

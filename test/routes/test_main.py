# @ Description: This script initializes the FastAPI application, configures
# routes for# managing RSS feed ingestion and news article scraping using
# Scrapy, and establishes a connection pool to a PostgreSQL database using
# asyncpg. It includes lifecycle event handlers to manage the connection pool
# during startup and shutdown. When executed directly, it launches the
# application with Uvicorn in development mode with hot-reloading enabled

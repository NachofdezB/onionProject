Either the DOGE agent is rooted, the DOGE agent willingly is transmitting those credentials to a 3rd XYZ party, potentially in Russia, or someone on the extremely short list with access to those credentials is trying to make it ‘look like’ ‘Russia’ is attempting access – presumably for the point of making the situation look even more serious and drawing more scrutiny.  In all three scenarios that’s a very real problem that needs solved – immediately.

We don’t have any information yet beyond that fact, but it seems to me if you’ve got credentials being given to DOGE for unfettered access to a sensitive system, (which you cede is the ‘main’ part of this) and 15 minutes later someone “in Russia” (or even someone with a VPN pretending to be) is using those exact brand new credentials in attempting to gain access… I’d say that’s a material fact and not something you can just shrug off as unrelated or unimportant.  Either the DOGE agent is rooted, the DOGE agent willingly is transmitting those credentials to a 3rd XYZ party, potentially in Russia, or someone on the extremely short list with access to those credentials is trying to make it ‘look like’ ‘Russia’ is attempting access – presumably for the point of making the situation look even more serious and drawing more scrutiny.  In all three scenarios that’s a very real problem that needs solved – immediately.  Like you say it’s important that the data was stolen, but each step of proving how/what/where/why/who is potentially as important as the next.

And while Passkeys show promise they are immature and still hampered by eco system fragmentation and vendor lock-in e.g., iCloud vs. Google.", "It’s also worth noting that one of FIDO2’s core strengths is phishing resistance via origin binding, that is, a key won’t authenticate unless the domain matches exactly.
